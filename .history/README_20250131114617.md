## 👨‍💻 About Me

It all started when I was about 8. My grandpa had an **IBM clone** with no hard drive and two **5.25-inch floppy drives**. To use it, I had to insert the **DOS floppy disk**, boot the machine, and load the OS into memory. Once it was loaded, I could remove the floppy. I used to play this hideous submarine simulator called **Gato**. 🕹️

*🖥️ Not an IBM clone but an actual IBM PC with dual floppy drives just like my grandpa's clone.*

Around the same time, I discovered **BASIC** programming. Writing simple loops and printing messages on the screen blew my little mind! 🤯 That early spark of curiosity ignited my lifelong passion for programming. 💡

As I got older, I stumbled upon **HTML** and began publishing weird, chaotic websites on **Angelfire** and **Geocities**. Blink tags, tiled backgrounds, and autoplaying MIDI files—it was a wild time! 🎶😂 But it cemented my love for web development.

Fast forward 30 years, and here I am, still exploring the endless possibilities of the web! 🌍💻

I know by now you must be wondering where have I been all your life. But there's no time to dwell on the past.
