          <p class="card-text">
            Hey there! I'm <strong>PhobiaCide</strong>, a passionate web developer who thrives on
            clean code, pixel-perfect designs, and user-friendly experiences.

              My journey into tech started when I was 8 years old, tinkering with my grandpa's IBM clone,
              which had no hard drive and relied on two 5.25-inch floppy drives. I had to boot DOS from a floppy disk,
              load it into memory, and then swap disks to run applications. One of my earliest experiences with a
              computer
              was playing a crude submarine simulator called <strong>Gato</strong>—and that's where my fascination with
              technology began.

          <p>
            But computers weren't just something I used; they were something I explored. I had a math textbook that
            included <strong>BASIC programming snippets</strong>, and I spent hours typing them out just to see what
            they did.
            Even if I didn't fully understand how everything worked at the time, I knew I had unlocked something
            special:
            the ability to make a machine <strong>do what I wanted</strong>—a superpower in the making.
          </p>
          <img src="https://github.com/PhobiaCide/portfolio/blob/main/assets/img/BASIC.png=true" alt="BASIC Snippet"
            class="img-fluid rounded mx-auto d-block mb-3" />
          <p>
            In middle school, I had access to a bunch of <strong>Apple II computers</strong> that were mostly gathering
            dust.
            While my classmates saw them as relics, I saw them as an opportunity. After finishing my work, I'd
            experiment
            with them, learning through trial and error. Even my piano teacher had an <strong>Apple IIc</strong>, and
                while my sister
                practiced her scales, I was busy pushing the boundaries of what I could make a computer do. Every moment
                spent on those machines deepened my curiosity and my drive to learn more.
          </p>
          <img src="https://github.com/PhobiaCide/portfolio/blob/main/assets/img/appleII.jpg?raw=true" alt="Apple II"
            class="img-fluid rounded mx-auto d-block mb-3" />
          <p>
            By the time the internet was in full swing, I was building web pages on <strong>Angelfire</strong> and
            <strong>GeoCities</strong>,
            cobbling together clunky, over-the-top designs with flashing text and tiled backgrounds. Looking back,
            they were chaotic and messy—but they were mine. And more importantly, they were proof that I could
            create something from nothing.
          </p>
          <p>
            Fast forward to today, and that same curiosity still drives me. I've spent the past <strong>five
              years</strong>
            honing my skills, teaching myself <strong>modern front-end development</strong>, and building projects that
            solve
            real problems. My experience isn't backed by a degree or a fancy certification—it's built on passion,
            persistence, and an unshakable belief that <strong>if I don't know how to do something, I'll figure it
              out.</strong>
          </p>
          <p>
            Now, I specialize in crafting <strong>responsive, accessible, and high-performance</strong> web applications
            using
            modern front-end technologies. Whether it's building interactive dashboards, streamlining user experiences,
            or optimizing performance, I bring ideas to life—one line of code at a time. 🚀
